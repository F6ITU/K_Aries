A French version of the main documentation and user's note could be found in the "Documentation" directory

Main differences are : 

* - dual footprint  for the I2C ram (hard to find in SOIC package)
* - R19 trace bug corrected
* - input-output coax connector changed (Amphenol bnc straight with reference)
* - F-CU ground "forbiden zone" modified around tandem match output (R42-E42-R1-R2 of the original design)
* - dual footprint for 12V input J4 (Molex kk 2.54mm and Phoenix high current "board to wire" connector)
* - same Tianbo TRA2 L-12VDC-S-Z relay used for ATU and antenna switch 
(small mod for the "bypass" relay Total relay count is 22 TRA2 now
